# Graph-Theory

This is the most important algorithms in Graph Theory. I already this since highschool. 
However all the codes was mostly written in Pascal back then.
Therefore,I will rewrite all of my codes in C++ and update everything one bye one.
It is also a good way for me to revise everything I've learnt. ^^

All the information about the input is in the InputType.txt
