# Algorithms and Data Structures

My implementation and some notes to review when needed. More description is in the file.

## Algorithm
- [Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm:](../master/Algorithms/KMP.cpp) In computer science, the Knuth–Morris–Pratt string-searching algorithm (or KMP algorithm) searches for occurrences of a "word" W within a main "text string" S by employing the observation that when a mismatch occurs, the word itself embodies sufficient information to determine where the next match could begin, thus bypassing re-examination of previously matched characters.
- [Modular Exponentiation:](../master/Algorithms/ModularExponentiation.cpp) Given three numbers x, y and p, compute (x^y) % p. Here we also take care of large numbers.

## Data structures
- [Adjacency list:](../master/AdjacencyList.cpp) In graph theory and computer science, an adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a vertex in the graph. It is easy to find all the neighbor of a node.
- [Edge list](../master/EdgeList.cpp) Edge list describes the set of neighbors of a vertex in the graph. Each element describe an edge with two vertices.
