Input given for:
  + Hamilton Cycle: n - number of vertex, m - number of edge, k - the start of Hamilton cycle. Each of the next m lines contain an edge             meaning there is a connection from x -> y.
  + Strong Connected Component: m - number of edge, n - vertex.
  + Disjoint Set Union: m - number of edge, n - vertex.
